SimpleLang
==========

A Simple programming Language based on Java 1.7

I will make a simple language without tools like JavaCC or other. Peoples would say : "Oh, that's too simple!". I know,
it's just for fun.

How to
======

1) Build
--------

Just compile the code from the Main class

2) Test
-------

For the moment, you can't test your own code because the language is too newer! :(
