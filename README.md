SimpleLang
==========

A Simple programming Language based on Java 1.7

SimpleLang, as its name suggests, is a simple language based on JavaCC. The purpose of the project is to have fun while surpassing me.


How to
------

1) Build

Just compile the code from the Main class

2) Test

For the moment, you can't test your own code because the language is too newer! :(
